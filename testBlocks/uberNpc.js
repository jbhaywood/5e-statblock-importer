Actions
Multiattack. The ruinant makes three Bloodletting
Claws attacks.
Bloodletting Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus
7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the target can’t take reactions
this turn.
Javelin. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 +

Paralyzing Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +12 to hit, reach

target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving
throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
Legendary Actions
The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options below. Only one legendary action option
can be used at a time and only at the end of another
creature’s turn. The lich regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.
Cantrip. The lich casts a cantrip.
Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions). The lich fixes its
gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it.
The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving
throw against this magic or become frightened for 1
minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw
is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is
immune to the lich’s gaze for the next 24 hours.
Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions). Each non-­‐undead
creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC
18 Constitution saving throw against this magic,
taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
Mythic Actions

If Arasta’s mythic trait is active, she can use the options below as legendary actions, as long as she has temporary hit points from her Armor of Spiders.

Swipe. Arasta makes two attacks with her claws.

Web of Hair (Costs 2 Actions). Arasta recharges Web of Hair and uses it.

Nyx Weave (Costs 2 Actions). Each creature restrained by Arasta’s Web of Hair must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, or the creature takes 26 (4d12) force damage and any spell of 6th level or lower on it ends.
BONUS ACTIONS
Mesmerizing Eyes. The glowing eyes of Emer’s snakes gaze
at one creature Emer can see within 60 feet of her. If the
target can see Emer, they must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed until the start of the target’s next
turn. A target charmed in this way must immediately use their
reaction, if available, to move up to their speed in a direction
of Emer’s choice.
REACTIONS
Blinding Mucus. When a creature Emer can see within 5 feet
of her hits her with a melee attack, Emer spits venom at their
eyes. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or take 7 (2d6) acid damage and be blinded until the
start of their next turn.
VILLAIN ACTIONS
Emer has three villain actions. She can take each action once
during an encounter after an enemy’s turn. She can take these
actions in any order but can use only one per round.
Action 1: I See You! Emer uses Stone Gaze against each
enemy she can see within 60 feet of her.
Action 2: Medusa’s Evolution. Emer grows wings from her
back, gaining a flying speed of 40 feet, then she moves
up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
After 1 minute, the wings crumble to dust and her flying
speed is lost.
Action 3: Stone Puppets. Emer mentally manipulates the
stone in each creature who is being turned to stone by her
Stone Gaze. Emer and each of those creatures move up to
their speed then make a weapon attack against a creature
of Emer’s choice (no action required).

Lair Actions


While Strahd is in Castle Ravenloft, he can take lair actions as long as he isn’t incapacitated.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Strahd can take one of the following lair action options, or forgo using any of them in that round:

    Until initiative count 20 of the next round, Strahd can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if they weren’t there.
    Strahd targets any number of doors and windows that he can see, causing each one to either open or close as he wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (needing a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until Strahd chooses to end the effect, or until Strahd uses this lair action again.
    Strahd summons the angry spirit of one who has died in the castle. The apparition appears next to a hostile creature that Strahd can see, makes an attack against that creature, and then disappears. The apparition has the statistics of a specter.
    Strahd targets one Medium or smaller creature that casts a shadow. The target’s shadow must be visible to Strahd and within 30 feet of him. If the target fails a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, its shadow detaches from it and becomes a shadow that obeys Strahd’s commands, acting on initiative count 20. A greater restoration spell or a remove curse spell cast on the target restores its natural shadow, but only if its undead shadow has been destroyed.
